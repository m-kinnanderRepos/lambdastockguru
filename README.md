Initial main branch will only contain this README.md file. 
I've created a samle lambda using the `cdk init sample-app language python` command. 
I'm looking at the documenation and I think I want to start this project with sample-app though I haven't created an example without `sample-app` specified. 
I'll start with main branch only having this README.md file and then branch off of main to start the `cdk init sample-app language python` command.
I may branch off of main and do a test run without having `sample-app` specified.
Keeping main branch clean allows for me to do this.
